Transforming the problem to
min ||P + a1*v1 + a2*v2 + a3*v3 - Q - b1*w1 - b2*w2 - b3*w3||^2
s.t a1 + a2 + a3 <= 1
    b1 + b2 + b3 <= 1
    a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3 >= 0
A solution was found dividing the interval [0,1] into several parts
and evaluating each variable in these points.
This solution is terrible and slow.
The mathematical approach may be too slow.
 
 
High School Physics
---------------------------
Considering t0 = 0, x0 = 0 and v0 = 0, we have

v(t) = a*t
x(t) = 0.5*a*t^2

Since v(t1) = v1 is given we have

a = v1/t1

and since we want x(2*t1), we have

x(2*t1) = 0.5*(v1/t1)*(2*t1)^2 = 2*v1*t1

Ecological Premium
---------------------------
The premium: divide the area(A) by the number of animals(N),
multiply by the env-friendliness(E), and multiply by the
animals (again?).
Result: A*E
